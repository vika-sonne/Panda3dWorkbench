History
-------

* Improved on 14.04.2020 by Victoria D.

Introduced a new parametric object-oriented fractal generator.

Added demo of game environment with hundred unique trees. You can use resources/speed adaptation with ten unique trees types (for excample) and just copying it as `NodePath` to many locations. Also, selected trees from generated geometry can be saved and used while game time as having pretty-looking style.
